## Flame Game Engine tutorials in ClojureDart

I'm convinced that ClojureDart is a game changer. 

### Flame Engine Tutorials

The primary goal of this repository is to re-create the Flame Engine tutorials that can be found [here](https://docs.flame-engine.org/1.6.0/tutorials/tutorials.html) in ClojureDart.

Currently working through Klondike tutorial step 4 - progress made up to [here](https://docs.flame-engine.org/main/tutorials/klondike/step4.html#moving-a-run-of-cards).

After Klondike the repo will be re-organized.
