# ClojureDart Game Lab

## Flame Game Engine tutorials in ClojureDart

I'm convinced that ClojureDart is a game changer. 

There is irrefutable evidence of this fact contained within the walls of this place. Flame is a game engine for Flutter that allows for building games. To build games, one must change games. Flutter exists within the Dart ecosystem and ClojureDart extends Clojure's reach to Dart. The careful reader of the code contained here will notice what appears to be ClojureDart enabling Clojure to change games. 

ClojureDart is a game changer.

### Flame Engine Tutorials

The primary goal of this repository is to re-create the Flame Engine tutorials that can be found [here](https://docs.flame-engine.org/1.6.0/tutorials/tutorials.html) in ClojureDart.

The Klondike tutorial up to step 4 can be found here in the `main.cljd` file for now.
